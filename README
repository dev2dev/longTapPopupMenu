This is menu that looks like popup UI element that appears when you
do long tap on the iOS keyboard globe button to bring up language 
selector. You can attach such menu to any UI element, provide it
some info (item titles, index of selected title) and it will notify
you when user taps on some item via delegate protocol.
Everything is drawn programmatically, it just works, etc.
